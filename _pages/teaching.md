### Professional + Mentorship Experience
---

<p> <font size="+1.5">
<b class = 'bold' >Office of Cultural & Academic Transitions, Michigan State University</b>
<br>
Intercultural Aide, supervisor: Maggie Chen-Hernandez
<br>
<i> Fall 2014, Spring 2015, Fall 2015</i>
<br>
As an intercultural aide, I focused on providing a welcoming, safe, and comfortable community for an estimated 200 assigned dormitory residents; while working with other intercultural aides and resident assistants.
Our combined efforts led to higher retention rates within the university through one-on-one conversation, implementing campus & external events, and other special initiatives.
<br> <br>
A priority for intercultural aides was to spend more time with students the university deemed as at risk.
This meant that more providing myself more as a direct mentor to these students.
It was amazing to see these scholars graduate, as I have been at Michigan State University long enough to see this happen.
<br> <br>
Along with this, intercultural aides were responsible for planning round table discussions about controversial issues in an open and safe environment for participants.
This required us to be culturally and socially aware, and we achieved this by constantly reading literature provided by staff on these topics.

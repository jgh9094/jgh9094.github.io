I am currently a first-generation Latino doctoral student at working with Dr. Charles Ofria in the [Digital Evolution Laboratory](https://devolab.org/) at [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/)
  in the departments of [Computer Science and Engineering](http://cse.msu.edu/)
  and [Ecology, Evolutionary Biology, & Behavior](https://eebb.natsci.msu.edu/),
  and I am a member of the [BEACON Center for the Study of Evolution in Action](https://beacon-center.org/).
I completed both my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science with a minor in Mathematics in 2017 and master’s degree in Computer Science in 2019 at [Michigan State University](https://msu.edu/).

I grew up in Fresno, California then moved to East Lansing, Michigan to begin my journey on becoming a Computer Science college graduate.
At a young age I had no knowledge of college, but was fortunate to be introduced to the college preparation program [AVID]( https://www.avid.org/).
My aspirations to become a Spartan would come from a self-assessment quiz to discover colleges and majors.
The notion that my life could change for the better inspired me to want to become the first college graduate in my family.

My journey to becoming a computer science college graduate inspired me to become a professor who conducts novel research, emboldens future scholars, and creates a truly inclusive environment that will nurture students most at-risk of dropping out.
The support I have received from amazing friends, mentors, and teachers also does not go unnoticed, thank you all so much!

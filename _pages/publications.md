### Research Experience

<p> <font size="+1.5">
<b class = 'bold' >Digital Evolution Laboratory, Michigan State University</b>
<br>
Graduate student, advisor: Charles Ofria
<br>
<i>Fall 2017 - present</i>
<br>
More details regarding projects during this time can be found at <a class="page-link" href="{{ '/research/' | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}">research</a>.
</font> </p>


<p> <font size="+1.5">
<b class = 'bold' >BEACON Center, Digital Evolution Laboratory, Michigan State University</b>
<br>
Undergraduate research intern, advisor(s): Charles Ofria & Alexander Lalejini
<br>
<i> Summer 2017</i>
<br>
As a member of the Digital Evolution Laboratory, I worked on a research that focused on using evolutionary computation to evolve distributed algorithms.
I implemented a virtual homogeneous distributed system, where nodes in the system are represented by genetic programs that must evolve into effective distributed algorithms to contend with energy conservation and coordination.
In the end, genetic programs were found that evolved into satisfactory solutions to contend with energy conservation and coordination within the distributed system environment.

<p> <font size="+1.5">
<b class = 'bold' >Embodied Intelligence Laboratory, Michigan State University</b>
<br>
Undergraduate research intern, advisor(s): Juyang Weng & Juan Castro-Garcia
<br>
<i> Summer 2016</i>
<br>
I implemented a graphical user interface that conducted statistical analysis on a computer systems performance and classification accuracy of a neural network. This interface allowed users of the neural network to tune hyperparameters, refine memory allocation, and reduce run time.

<p> <font size="+1.5">
<b class = 'bold' >Office of Cultural & Academic Transitions, Michigan State University</b>
<br>
Intercultural Aide, supervisor: Maggie Chen-Hernandez
<br>
<i> Fall 2014, Spring 2015, Fall 2015</i>
<br>
As an intercultural aide, I focused on providing a welcoming, safe, and comfortable community for an estimated 200 assigned dormitory residents; while working with other intercultural aides and resident assistants.
Our combined efforts led to higher retention rates within the university through one-on-one conversation, implementing campus & external events, and other special initiatives.

<p> <font size="+1.5">
<b class = 'bold' >Graduate Studies and Research Committee, Michigan State University</b>
<br>
Committee Member, representing:  Computer Science and Engineering Graduate Student Association (CSEGA)
<br>
<i> Fall 2019, Spring 2020, Fall 2020</i>
<br>
Participate in weekly meetings with faculty in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering to discuss and edit the graduate student handbook.
Along with this, I also relay concerns of graduate students within the department to faculty at these meetings.
Once every month I present main ideas that were discussed in these meetings to other graduate students at a general body meeting.

Intercultural Aide, supervisor: Maggie Chen-Hernandez

<i> Fall 2014, Spring 2015, Fall 2015</i>
<br />
Aside from the description given in <a class="page-link" href="/cv/">cv</a>, a subset of students deemed by the university as at risk were a priority for intercultural aides.
This meant that more one-on-one interactions and follow ups were needed with these students.
Along with this, intercultural aides were responsible for hosting round table discussions about controversial issues in an open and safe environment for participants.
This required intercultural aides to be culturally and socially aware, and this was achieved by constantly keeping up to date with literature and content provided by the supervisors.
There were also multiple trips to partake in community service activities with different organizations in the Lansing area.
